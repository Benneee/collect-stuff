# collect-stuff
Collect stuff from my favourite series downloading sites.

So I have this wonderful ritual of downloading latest episodes of my favourite series every week, it's almost a Wednesday or Thursday ritual. I'm tired of repeatedly going to the sites to download these things, what if I can "collect" the download URLs somewhere wonderful and download in say, two clicks without the crazy navigations. :)

I'll probably update this as time goes on.

So update time!

I did it! Check the dev branch, I'll merge to master when I'm done.
I collect the download URLs as mentioned above but I send it to my mail, how cool is that!
Up next, we deploy this thing, configure a cron job to run every Friday and mail me the URLs!

I'm so excited for what's ahead!
